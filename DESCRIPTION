Description: A system for solving problems of numerical, classification, logistic and forecasting (time series) data. You only provide the data, and one line of code to tell the package about the data
    and what you want returned, the package does everything else to build the optimal solution. This includes data visualizations, constructing individual models and indexed ensembles
    using 'R' and 'Python', creating regular learning and deep learning models, creating summary charts, tables and graphics, resampling as many times as you want, saving trained
    models (if you want) for future use or to share, predicting on totally new data (if you want), and removing highly correlated predictors in the ensembles
    (at any level you want, such as removing all features in the ensembles correlated above 0.95). The result is that the user receives a wide range of solutions
    to any numerical, classification, logistic or time series data set. Because the package creates indexed ensembles, the results from the Ensembles package
    typically meet or beat many published results by a wide margin.
