Note that this forecasting example will take several minutes to run on a normal system. The RStudio Console gives an update on the progress as it is running, it is helpful to monitor the Console as the forecasting function is running this demo. Of course the update is also provided as the function is used on data.

```{r setup}
library(Ensembles)

forecasting(time_series_data = Ensembles::total_nonfarm,
            train_amount = 0.60,
            number = 3,
            time_interval = "M",
            use_parallel = "Y")

warnings() # to confirm everything runs without any errors or warnings.

```
